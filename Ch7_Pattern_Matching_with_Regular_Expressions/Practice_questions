    -passing a re.I or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile()

15. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile()?
16. What is the difference between .* and .*??

19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allow you to do?
20. How would you write a regex that matches a number with commas for every three digits? It must match the following:
